00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:12,490
Hi, everyone. I am here today to show you how

2
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:17,200
an ending version of the Bikeshare Project could work.

3
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:18,760
And to do that,

4
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:22,924
we're going to look at two different examples because there are actually

5
00:00:22,924 --> 00:00:25,480
multiple ways that you could build something that would

6
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:29,155
pass the rubric items specific for this project.

7
00:00:29,155 --> 00:00:32,268
And, essentially, there's a template that's provided to you,

8
00:00:32,268 --> 00:00:35,125
but you should feel free to change that template however you would like to.

9
00:00:35,125 --> 00:00:39,505
So the function definitions and things that are provided in there,

10
00:00:39,505 --> 00:00:41,325
you can use as they are,

11
00:00:41,325 --> 00:00:45,615
but if something doesn't make sense to how you imagine you're ending project working,

12
00:00:45,615 --> 00:00:47,895
feel free to change the inputs to it,

13
00:00:47,895 --> 00:00:49,485
change what it returns.

14
00:00:49,485 --> 00:00:52,860
The main thing is that you get an ending prototype,

15
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:57,315
an ending portfolio project working in a way where

16
00:00:57,315 --> 00:01:02,250
it interacts with the user and provides the information that are asked within the rubric.

17
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:06,315
So with that, I'm going to take a look at two solutions.

18
00:01:06,315 --> 00:01:09,090
So one is the solution.py file,

19
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:11,475
and the other is a bikeshare.py file,

20
00:01:11,475 --> 00:01:14,700
and these are both correct solutions to what

21
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:18,830
a final project might look like for the Bikeshare Project.

22
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:23,488
If we were to run the bikeshare.py project,

23
00:01:23,488 --> 00:01:27,395
it says, "Which city would you like to see data from?"

24
00:01:27,395 --> 00:01:29,990
And let's say I say Chicago.

25
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:33,080
And then says, "Would you like to filter the data by month,

26
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:35,180
day, both, or not at all?"

27
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:37,400
Type none for no time filter.

28
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:40,445
You can see that this asks for each of these,

29
00:01:40,445 --> 00:01:44,120
which wasn't specified in the original filter provided by

30
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:48,740
the template but this was an advanced feature that was provided in the solution.

31
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:51,630
So let's say I say both,

32
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:52,920
and it says "Which month?"

33
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,750
And I'll say February.

34
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:58,200
And then which day? Please give it as an integer.

35
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:03,390
Let's say 3. Cool. So it says the most popular hour

36
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:08,745
was 17 with a count of 723 when you did this filter.

37
00:02:08,745 --> 00:02:12,900
The total duration was this, a count of this.

38
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,655
The average duration was here.

39
00:02:14,655 --> 00:02:16,636
Again, the filter was both.

40
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:18,600
Calculated the most popular station,

41
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:23,565
so the most popular start station was here with a count of 122.

42
00:02:23,565 --> 00:02:26,190
The most popular end station was here with a count of 110.

43
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:27,845
And, again, the filter was both.

44
00:02:27,845 --> 00:02:31,780
So you can see that this is one potential solution for this,

45
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:34,105
where it's telling me how long it took,

46
00:02:34,105 --> 00:02:38,008
and it gives me a whole bunch of other information.

47
00:02:38,008 --> 00:02:40,930
It says, "Would you like to see individual trip data?"

48
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:44,200
I say yes, and it gives me some information back.

49
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,360
And then I can say no, and it says,

50
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,950
"Would you like to restart?" And I'll say no.

51
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:51,970
Cool. So that is one potential solution to this.

52
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:55,942
Let's take a look at another one in a different example.

53
00:02:55,942 --> 00:02:58,530
It says, "Which one would you like to explore?"

54
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:01,680
So you can see they've built in this thing where it says,

55
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,615
"It looks like you want to hear about Washington.

56
00:03:03,615 --> 00:03:05,715
If that's not true, restart the program."

57
00:03:05,715 --> 00:03:07,415
So they built in a check,

58
00:03:07,415 --> 00:03:11,715
where it says it sort of builds in this filter of what they're going to do.

59
00:03:11,715 --> 00:03:15,038
You can see that that was sort of done in the end of that other example,

60
00:03:15,038 --> 00:03:16,695
but both of those are acceptable.

61
00:03:16,695 --> 00:03:18,300
"Would you like to filter by day,

62
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:19,995
month or not at all?"

63
00:03:19,995 --> 00:03:21,480
So let's just say,

64
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,385
in this case, let's do month.

65
00:03:23,385 --> 00:03:25,275
"Which month do you want?"

66
00:03:25,275 --> 00:03:27,150
May.

67
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:31,680
Cool. And so you can see that this one started calculating all those statistics,

68
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,605
and you can see it was a little bit faster.

69
00:03:34,605 --> 00:03:39,300
The way that it shows the information is a little bit different.

70
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:40,465
So you can see it says,

71
00:03:40,465 --> 00:03:42,120
"What's the breakdown of users?"

72
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,635
And that looks like this,

73
00:03:43,635 --> 00:03:48,390
and "What is the most popular station?"

74
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:52,515
So the most popular start and end station and here's the count.

75
00:03:52,515 --> 00:03:56,370
You can see what's the total traveling time done,

76
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:59,625
and it gives it back in a little bit different format.

77
00:03:59,625 --> 00:04:02,089
"What's the most popular hour of the day?"

78
00:04:02,089 --> 00:04:03,420
It says 5.

79
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:06,315
"What's the most popular day for traveling?" It's Wednesday.

80
00:04:06,315 --> 00:04:11,880
So you can see that this one actually gave you a little bit less up front in terms of

81
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,950
like how you're filtering and that was

82
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:17,595
because I only filtered by month and the other one filtered by both.

83
00:04:17,595 --> 00:04:19,048
So it says, "Would you like to restart?"

84
00:04:19,048 --> 00:04:20,940
Let's just do a restart on this one.

85
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:24,270
So it says, "Would you like to filter by which city?"

86
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:28,440
I'll say Chicago, and let's say I filter by day.

87
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:31,665
So here notice that it says you can filter by this

88
00:04:31,665 --> 00:04:35,445
based on not a number but like on one of these letter values.

89
00:04:35,445 --> 00:04:37,438
So I'm going to say Thursday,

90
00:04:37,438 --> 00:04:40,770
and then it calculates the information for me based on that filter.

91
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:46,380
So again these are just two different ways to show the information at the end but,

92
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:48,300
in general, it needs to be interactive,

93
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:52,845
and it needs to show the statistics that are specified based on the rubric.

94
00:04:52,845 --> 00:04:55,490
And those are really the only two restrictions.

95
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:58,440
So it should meet the rubric by giving

96
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:02,378
an interactive experience and calculating the statistics necessary,

97
00:05:02,378 --> 00:05:04,410
but the template should just serve as a guide,

98
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:07,110
and you should feel free to change that however

99
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:09,960
you think you want your program to interact with the user.

100
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:12,540
Build in as much interactivity as you want to,

101
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:15,945
and you should feel comfortable being creative in your solution.

102
00:05:15,945 --> 00:05:18,495
I hope this is helpful. Thanks for joining me.

103
00:05:18,495 --> 00:05:20,890
Good luck with your projects.
